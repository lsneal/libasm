# Simple Functions in ASM x86_64

This repository contains simple functions written in x86_64 assembly using Intel syntax. It's designed to help you learn and understand assembly language programming.

## Registers

In x86_64 assembly, the following 64-bit registers are commonly used:

- **`rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`**: General-purpose registers.
- **`rsi`, `rdi`**: Used for passing function arguments.
- **`rbp`**: Base pointer for stack frames.
- **`rsp`**: Stack pointer.
- **`r8` to `r15`**: Additional general-purpose registers.
- **`rip`**: Instruction pointer.
